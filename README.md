==========

Data driven approach to automatic air-drumming sound annotation.

Usage: run vid_capture.py to take a video of yourself air-drumming. Then run soundpound.py to generate the sound of drums.

Note: The data set I am using is unfortunately proprietary. Please see http://www.tsi.telecom-paristech.fr/aao/en/2010/02/19/enst-drums-an-extensive-audio-visual-database-for-drum-signals-processing/ for access.
